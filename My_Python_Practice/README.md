# Zero to Hero in Python Practice

This is a repository for my Python practice, specifically for exercises related to Jose Portilla's "Zero to Hero in Python" course. All of the practice files are in the form of `.ipynb` notebooks and were created using Jupyter Notebooks and Visual Studio Code.

## Daily Code Commits

I will aim to commit code daily, time permitting, to keep track of my progress in the course.

## Repository Structure

The current directory contains all of the Python practice files related to the course. It is organized into subdirectories based on week number (e.g. "Week 1", "Week 2", etc.) and each weekly subdirectory will contain daily contributions. The structure of the repository is as follows:
